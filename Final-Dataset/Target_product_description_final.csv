Our Daily Shampoo is the coastal companion you can count on far from the beach.

We fill these bottles with Agave Nectar, Sunflower Seed Oil, and our proprietary Coconut Cleansing Complex; completely avoiding bogus, harsh sulfates.

How it’s done:

1. Pop open your bottle and you’ll be warmly met by our signature scent of dreamwood and bergamot.
2. Close your eyes, lather the shampoo into your hair – being sure to massage the foaming formula into your roots and ends – and let the woody, citrusy fragrance transport you to the Golden State.
3. Rinse. Condition. Get back to living. Then repeat again tomorrow.

Conditioner isn’t reserved for the shower. Sometimes it doesn’t want to be washed out. Equal parts primer, detangler, and styler, our clean, 3-in-1 Leave-in Conditioner is the perfect first step in your post-shower routine. Coconut Milk helps provide instant hydration, while Sunflower Sprout Extract & Mongongo Oil work to keep strands soft, shiny-smooth, and frizz free.

How it’s done:

1. Pump the conditioner 1-2 times into your palm and rub between your hands.
2. Apply on damp hair, from the middle to the ends. It likes to be first, so use it before anything else in your post-shower hair routine.
3. There’s no need to rinse, just leave it in and fall in love with the results.

Balancing protein-rich and moisturizing products in your routine is key to healthy, strong hair. The more damaged and porous your hair is, the more protein-rich products you should use. Curlsmith Multi-Tasking Conditioner is a protein-enriched 3-in-1 moisturizer that hydrates your hair while making it look stronger and more elastic.

HOW THE MAGIC HAPPENS:
We developed our Multi-Tasking Conditioner to be lightweight in texture but packed with moisturizing ingredients, so that depending on application it can work as a rinse-out conditioner, a deep conditioner or a leave-in conditioner. It is also supercharged with a patented, innovative ingredient that helps strengthen the internal hair structure up to 3 times. This is a unique technology that works by creating additional hydrogen and ionic bonds within the hair keratin structure, helping to strengthen the hair shaft from the inside.

WHAT MAKES CURLSMITH DIFFERENT:
Inspired by generations of homemade hair remedies, Curlsmith blends fresh curl-loving foods with kitchen cupboard staples and rare ingredients to make premium products that really work. The Multi-Tasking Conditioner is blended with a unique complex of Rice Protein & Hemp Oil, a fully plant-based alternative to animal keratin that makes the hair look stronger and more elastic.

NO NASTIES:
All Curlsmith products have zero spoons of sulphates, silicones, mineral oils and phthalates. Plus they’re Vegan and Cruelty Free.

HOW TO USE:
As a conditioner: leave on for 1-2 minutes, then rinse to instantly detangle, smooth and revive your hair.
As a deep conditioner: leave on for 15-30 minutes, then rinse to deeply nourish and replenish your strands.
As a leave-in: rake through wet, freshly washed hair to maintain moisture and plump curls until the next wash, then follow with your favorite Curlsmith styler.","Paraben-Free, Silicone-Free, Sulfate-Free, Gluten-Free, Phthalate-Free","3in1 rinse-out, leave-in and deep conditioner, Nourishes the hair and helps it look stronger and more elastic, Enhances and helps clump waves and curls, Makes hair soft, smooth and shiny, Enriched with proteins to fortify the hair, Contains bond-building actives to repair, Light silky texture, Designed for all curls and texture types"

Our products are made from natural and simple ingredients that you can smell beneath every one of our caps. It’s our mission to storm the private, gate-kept beaches that luxury hair and body companies have commandeered; to tear down their stingy signs, let down our hair, lose a few articles of clothing, and go public with a roster of products designed for a life spent under the sun.

If our Daily Shampoo is the co-pilot to your coastal vacation, our Daily Conditioner is the wax giving your ride that beautiful silky, smooth shine. Our conditioner is designed with simple and natural ingredients. We’ve swapped stressful silicones out for nutrient-rich fruit butters and healing herbal extracts. Avocado & Coconut Milk deeply nourish dry hair, while Geranium & Sunflower Oils melt into your mop to give it that Golden State Glow.

How it’s done:

1. After you’ve rinsed our Daily Shampoo away, massage a generous amount of our Conditioner onto your ends, slowly working your way up to your roots. Let that soak for a minute or two.
2. Next, and this a pro-tip, rinse with cold water to help seal the cuticle and lock in moisture.
3. Once you’re done, dry your mane, return to your day, and do it all again tomorrow.

Our products are made from natural and simple ingredients that you can smell beneath every one of our caps. It’s our mission to storm the private, gate-kept beaches that luxury hair and body companies have commandeered; to tear down their stingy signs, let down our hair, lose a few articles of clothing, and go public with a roster of products designed for a life spent under the sun.

Your hair deserves a vacation. Our Hair Masque has opted out of the silicones other masques use that leave your strands stressed, for a nutrient-rich, buttery blend of Mango, Shea, and Avocado. These natural superfoods melt into each strand, helping to revitalize your hair to a natural, healthy, and effortless state.

How it’s done:

1. After you’ve cleansed with your California Naturals Shampoo, massage a quarter-size amount of our Masque between your palms and apply to your strands, giving some extra love to your mid-lengths & ends.
2. Wait for 3-5 minutes, before you rinse with cold water to help seal the cuticle and lock in moisture.
Feel free to vacation (masque) once a week, or more if you feel like it.

California Naturals designs products for people who want clean hair, clean bodies, and a clean consciouses. Our entire daily care roster is 90%+ naturally derived, ocean and reef safe, never tested on animals, Paraben, Sulfate, Phalate, & Gluten free, and made from 100% recycled packaging.","Vegan, Sulfate-Free, Gluten-Free, Dye-Free, Phthalate-Free, Paraben-Free, Aluminum-Free","Nutrient-rich, buttery blend of Mango, Shea & Avocado, Helps to revitalize hair with natural superfoods, Melts in effortlessly and helps to lock in moisture, Naturally Derived (90%+) ingredients & 100% Recycled Packaging"

Nexxus scientists set out to find inspiration from precious ingredients that could help seal severely damaged hair using a leading edge approach to protein research called Proteomics. The Nexxus Keraphix Healing System for Severely Damaged Hair, with Keratin Protein and Black Rice, heals visible signs of severe hair damage. Rice has long been a storied secret of strong heathy hair for women of the Huangluo village in China, where fermented rice water has unlocked the key to growing long, luxurious hair. Women of the village go to great lengths to preserve their hair by washing it in fermented rice water and often undergo just one haircut their entire lifetime. Extensive testing showed that Glutamic Acid is a key amino acid lost in hair when it is exposed to severe damage. After finding that Black Rice was among the richest sources of Glutamic Acid in nature, Nexxus combined this ingredient with Keratin Protein and other essential nutrients to create a new hair healing ritual for clinically proven healthy-looking hair with just one use. Salon-crafted with our exclusive PROTEINFUSION blend with Keratin Protein and Black Rice, Keraphix Mask moisturizes deeply inside the hair.

Balancing protein-rich and moisturizing products in your routine is key to strengthen and protect the hair against damage. The more damaged and porous your hair is, the more protein-rich products you should use. Curlsmith Bond Curl Rehab Salve is an intense pre-shampoo treatment, rich in proteins that target hair bonds to strengthen and repair from the inside out.

HOW THE MAGIC HAPPENS:
Our hair is made of a keratin structure, which is reinforced by so-called hair bonds. There are 3 types of bonds that make up the hair structure: disulfide bonds, which are damaged by bleach and chemical treatments; salt bonds, which are damaged by sudden pH imbalance; hydrogen bonds, which are damaged by excess of moisture and heat. Curlsmith Bond Curl Rehab Salve is a powerful blend of superfoods and fortifying active ingredients that targets all 3 of these bonds to repair, rebuild and restore hair fiber strength. It also provides protection to help against further damage.

WHAT MAKES CURLSMITH DIFFERENT:
Inspired by generations of homemade hair remedies, Curlsmith blends fresh curl-loving foods with kitchen cupboard staples and rare ingredients to make premium products that really work. The Bond Curl Rehab Salve is blended with shiitake, kale, prickly pear, blackcurrant and chia seeds, which have unique curl-enhancing properties and contain essential amino acids related to stronger-looking hair.

NO NASTIES:
All Curlsmith products have zero spoons of sulphates, silicones, mineral oils and phthalates. Plus they’re Vegan and Cruelty Free.

HOW TO USE
Apply generously on damp hair until it is fully saturated. Leave on for a minimum of 15 minutes, (or up to 30 if you have mid-high porosity hair due to colouring, heat styling or damage). Rinse off thoroughly and follow with your favorite Curlsmith Cleanser, Conditioner and Stylers. How often to apply the treatment depends on your hair porosity. To find this out, spray water on clean, product-free hair. High porosity: water absorbs immediately in the hair. Use every 2-3 wash days for 30 minutes. Medium porosity: water forms droplets and then absorbs in the hair. Use every 3-4 wash days for 20 minutes. Low porosity: water forms droplets on the surface of the hair. Use every 4-5 wash days for 15 minutes.","Paraben-Free, Dye-Free, Aluminum-Free","Pre-shampoo bond-building treatment, Repairs and strengthens the hair, Targets all 3 bonds that make the hair structure, Enriched with proteins to fortify the hair, Protects the hair from further damage, Tames frizz and makes curls more defined, Must have for damaged, bleached or high porosity, Designed for all curls and texture types"

From the Pros:
For a piece-y look, use fingers to separate the ends of hair.

Start small and build till you find what you like. Lift a section of hair up and apply our texturizing spray underneath to determine your desired amount of product, then move from mid lengths to ends or all over. Rake fingers through hair to distribute.

To support texture, try spraying with your head upsidedown. Want a midday boost? Apply this hair mist at the root and give hair a tousle.
