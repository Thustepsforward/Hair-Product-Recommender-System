Nexxus scientists set out to find inspiration from precious ingredients that could help seal severely damaged hair using a leading edge approach to protein research called Proteomics. The Nexxus Keraphix Healing System for Severely Damaged Hair, with Keratin Protein and Black Rice, heals visible signs of severe hair damage. Rice has long been a storied secret of strong heathy hair for women of the Huangluo village in China, where fermented rice water has unlocked the key to growing long, luxurious hair. Women of the village go to great lengths to preserve their hair by washing it in fermented rice water and often undergo just one haircut their entire lifetime. Extensive testing showed that Glutamic Acid is a key amino acid lost in hair when it is exposed to severe damage. After finding that Black Rice was among the richest sources of Glutamic Acid in nature, Nexxus combined this ingredient with Keratin Protein and other essential nutrients to create a new hair healing ritual for clinically proven healthy-looking hair with just one use. Salon-crafted with our exclusive PROTEINFUSION blend with Keratin Protein and Black Rice, Keraphix Mask moisturizes deeply inside the hair. From the very first application, it helps to heal roughness and brittleness for smooth and healthy-looking hair. Nexxus New York Salon recommends: Step 1: Apply Keraphix Shampoo to wet hair and experience the rich foamy lather. Rinse thoroughly. Step 2: Follow with Keraphix Damage Healing Conditioner or Keraphix Masque for Severely Damaged Hair to help heal signs of damage. Press the butter-like texture from mid-length to ends. Comb through. Leave for 3-5 minutes. Rinse thoroughly.

Nexxus recognizes that amino acids are the “DNA” of our hair, bonding together to create the keratin protein found in each strand. When hair is damaged and these bonds break, amino acids are lost, leaving hair visibly damaged and weaker. Our Amino Bond™ bond repair system penetrates deep into your hair to repair 5 types of hair damage in minutes.","Product Ingredients":"Water (Eau), Cetyl Alcohol, Stearamidopropyl Dimethylamine, Dimethicone, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Glutamic Acid, Cysteine Hcl, Serine, Glycine, Histidine Hcl, Hydrolyzed Keratin, Collagen Amino Acids, Hydrolyzed Elastin, Polyquaternium Crosspolymer-3, Polyquaternium-28, Phenoxyethanol, Mineral Oil, Citric Acid, Glycerin, Distearoylethyl Dimonium Chloride, Fragrance (Parfum), Cetearyl Alcohol, Ethylhexyl Hydroxystearate, Acrylamidopropyltrimonium Chloride/Acrylamide Copolymer, Sodium Gluconate, Pvm/Ma Copolymer, Sorbitan Oleate, Trideceth-6, Sodium Citrate, Iodopropynyl Butylcarbamate, Coumarin, Hexyl Cinnamal, Limonene, Linalool, Bismuth Oxychloride (Ci 77163).","words":["water","(eau),","cetyl","alcohol,","stearamidopropyl","dimethylamine,","dimethicone,","caprylic/capric","triglyceride,","glutamic","acid,","cysteine","hcl,","serine,","glycine,","histidine","hcl,","hydrolyzed","keratin,","collagen","amino","acids,","hydrolyzed","elastin,","polyquaternium","crosspolymer-3,","polyquaternium-28,","phenoxyethanol,","mineral","oil,","citric","acid,","glycerin,","distearoylethyl","dimonium","chloride,","fragrance","(parfum),","cetearyl","alcohol,","ethylhexyl","hydroxystearate,","acrylamidopropyltrimonium","chloride/acrylamide","copolymer,","sodium","gluconate,","pvm/ma","copolymer,","sorbitan","oleate,","trideceth-6,","sodium","citrate,","iodopropynyl","butylcarbamate,","coumarin,","hexyl","cinnamal,","limonene,","linalool,","bismuth","oxychloride","(ci","77163)."],"rawFeatures":{"type":0,"size":20,"indices":[0,1,2,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17],"values":[6.0,3.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,7.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,6.0,8.0,1.0]},"ingredient_features":{"type":0,"size":20,"indices":[0,1,2,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17],"values":[0.5271053407280886,0.5934772299897596,0.10821358464023279,0.24096032150942687,0.42096929464412963,0.6858628585214267,0.5582273408237765,0.7864650793450598,0.37822760545579676,0.44659218835547015,0.08709519819824302,0.4328549292056699,0.2847723695862154,0.4280687636149586,0.1811694116758135,0.2415592155677513,0.18787541247675185]},"product_type_index":7.0,"features":{"type":1,"values":[0.5271053407280886,0.5934772299897596,0.10821358464023279,0.0,0.24096032150942687,0.42096929464412963,0.6858628585214267,0.5582273408237765,0.7864650793450598,0.37822760545579676,0.44659218835547015,0.08709519819824302,0.4328549292056699,0.2847723695862154,0.4280687636149586,0.1811694116758135,0.2415592155677513,0.18787541247675185,0.0,0.0,7.0]}},

That's why we've developed TRESemmé Flawless Curls Combing Crème. Our professional-quality formula provides optimal hydration while detangling and taming frizz for soft, defined, flawless curls. Not only does curly hair tend to be drier than other hair types, but it's also more affected by humidity. You need a curl cream that moisturizes and provides frizz control without weighing your hair down. Our TRESemmé Flawless Curls Combing Crème is a lightweight styling hair cream that replenishes the moisture in your hair's driest areas, providing optimal curl hydration to detangle hair, tame frizz, and boost shine. How to use: Apply evenly to damp or dry hair. For mid-length curls, use a quarter-size, and add more for longer hair. Comb through with a wide-tooth comb or fingers. Start from the ends and slowly work through the hair, section by section, moving upwards. Only move to the next section once the current section is fully tangle-free. TRESemmé is an industry leader in providing you with salon-ready hair quality products. Our unique formulas in this combing cream result from years of scientific research, with every ingredient carefully selected to ensure your hair receives the best possible care.
